# 🚨 Attention BLACKBOX.AI Users! 🚨

/* ******************************************** */
It appears that since i began posting about this,
blackbox.ai has changed portions of their Privacy 
and/or Terms to include (or exclude) "RESULTS",
whatever that means... I still wouldnt use this
extension in ANY IDE, nor would I use the Browser 
Extension, nor would I use the services they
provide.
