## Tracking Emails

The vast majority of the emails contain trackers... Most of them contain at least 3 trackers... Not only that, they send at least 2 emails per day and offer a free pro account that is actually not honored and if you have ublock or malwarebytes turned on, the links they send are blocked.

The email contains tracking pixels. Tracking pixels are typically small, invisible images embedded in emails to monitor recipient activity, such as opens or clicks. Here are the identified tracking pixels:

1. **Transparent tracking pixel**:
   - `<img border="0" width="1" height="1" src="https://blackbox-ai-32853b63f3c1.intercom-mail.com/q/0oWF-C8axzVHxxxxxxREEMXg~~/AAAAARA~/S2JupJxxxxyJ9rZxl7aCaymeof-Fyal0xKFiewiw_QqkBX0B4mFeP6CSYWBvbxxxxxxxxxxT4mZW3Cbt_Dxxxxxz3gw~~" alt="" />`
   - This pixel is hidden with attributes like `width="1"` and `height="1"`, making it invisible to the recipient.

2. **Another tracking pixel**:
   - `<img src="https://blackbox-ai-32853b63f3c1.intercom-mail.com/via/o?h=6a565xxxxxxaef17883xxxxxx09a7252fc-x55eda6t_xxxxxxx18" width="1" height="1" style="display: block;" alt="intercom">`
   - This pixel is used for monitoring purposes, as indicated by its dimensions and placement.

3. **Additional tracking pixel**:
   - `<img border="0" width="1" height="1" alt="" src="https://blackbox-ai-32853b63f3c1.intercom-mail.com/q/OVoYpxxxxU0xxxxWlQg~~/AAAAARA~/DZLPWRxxxxxxxojfaCBCBBvMrSuxxxxxxxxxxxt8LOVEm4inpTzLGfmqxChNYHplINxxxxxxxxxxbMww~~">`
   - Similar to the others, this pixel is designed to track recipient activity.

These tracking pixels are commonly used by email marketing platforms to gather analytics on user engagement. If you want to prevent tracking, you can disable image loading in your email client or use privacy-focused tools/extensions that block such trackers.

- Perplexity was used to find the trackers


Used Grok to confirm....

- ### Key Points
- Research suggests Blackbox AI's email contains tracking, including pixels for open tracking and click-tracking links, supporting your claims.
- It seems likely that these are standard practices via Intercom, but Blackbox AI's privacy policy lacks explicit mention, raising transparency concerns.
- The evidence leans toward no direct opt-out for tracking, requiring email client settings to block it.

### Direct Answer

**Overview**  
The email from Blackbox AI does indeed contain tracking mechanisms, which supports your concerns about their data collection practices. These include tracking pixels that monitor when you open the email and click-tracking links that record when you click on links, like the one to BLACKBOX.AI.

**Tracking Details**  
The email has small, invisible images (tracking pixels) that load when you open it, likely telling Blackbox AI you've viewed it. Links, such as the one to [BLACKBOX.AI](https://blackbox-bc48d2c6d814.intercom-clicks.com/via/e?ob=%2BAeeZaxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx4Nm2q7l7PpD%2FBSFeLKPFc%3D&h=451b14xxxxxxxxxxxxx528282-jlmqxicb_1xxxxxxxxxxxxxx82&l=dfc059fce38d0xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxbad9050514-129995864), are redirected through Intercom, their email service, to track clicks before sending you to the final page. This is standard for marketing emails, but Blackbox AI doesn't clearly mention it in their privacy policy, which might feel deceptive.

**Unexpected Detail**  
An interesting find is that while you can unsubscribe from future emails, there's no easy way to stop this tracking without blocking images in your email client, like Gmail, which isn't mentioned in the email itself.

**Implications**  
This confirms that there are multiple tracking mechanisms present in the uploaded sample email, but it's worth noting these are common practices. Still, the lack of transparency could be a concern, especially if you're worried about privacy.

### Comprehensive Analysis of Tracking in Blackbox AI's Email

This note provides a detailed examination of the tracking mechanisms present in an email sent by Blackbox AI, focusing on whether it supports the user's claims about deceptive practices. The analysis is based on a thorough review of the email content, supported by research into email tracking standards and the practices of Intercom, the email service provider used by Blackbox AI. The report aims to offer a professional and comprehensive overview, suitable for technical and non-technical audiences alike, and includes all relevant details from the analysis.

#### Background and Context
Blackbox AI, an AI coding assistant, sent an email to the user on December 6, 2024, at 16:29:21 PST, promoting unlimited premium access. The email was sent via Intercom, a customer messaging platform known for email marketing features. The user's concerns, inferred from previous discussions, center on Blackbox AI's potential deceptive practices, including tracking and data collection, particularly in their VS Code extension and services. This analysis focuses specifically on the email to determine if it contains tracking mechanisms that back up these claims.

#### Email Content and Tracking Mechanisms
The email is an HTML email with multiple components, including images and links. Tracking in emails typically involves tracking pixels (small, invisible images) and click-tracking links, both of which are present in this email.

- **Tracking Pixels:**  
  The email contains two 1x1 pixel images, which are classic tracking pixels used to monitor email opens. These are located at:
  - `<img src="https://blackbox-bc48d2c6d814.intercom-mail.com/via/o?h=0b85e27d19930dd041adaf5cc829dab660ab6860-jlmqxicb_177349782" width="1" height="1" style="display: block;" alt="intercom">`
  - `<img border="0" width="1" height="1" alt="" src="https://blackbox-bc48d2c6d814.intercom-mail.com/q/DQct7RRxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxOxLuGw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRpNhvgPlcIaW50xxxxxxxxxxxxx5haGN1Y2NpQGdtYWlsLmNvbVgEAAYeCA~~">`
  Both URLs include parameters like "h" (likely a hash or identifier) and user-specific data, suggesting they track when the email is opened. For example, the first URL includes "h=0b85e27d19930dd041adaf5cc829dab660ab6860-jlmqxicb_177349782," which appears unique to this email.

  Additionally, there is a main image with a URL:
  - `<img src="https://blackbox-bc48d2c6d814.intercom-mail.com/i/o/jlmqxicb/1280558303/abe3f1dd8806f6de633680e8a0d8/2.png?expires=1751410836&signature=9e8xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx51818ac693fba4763ec80b38086f1b431xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&req=dSIvFsx7lYJfWvMW2XS%xxxxxxxxxxxAJPD4S%2xxxxxxxxxxxxxx" align="center" width="497" style="...">`
  This image also includes parameters like "expires," "signature," and "req," which may serve as a tracking mechanism, potentially recording when it is loaded.

- **Click-Tracking Links:**  
  The email includes several links, such as:
  - A link to BLACKBOX.AI: `<a target="_blank" href="https://blackbox-bc48d2c6d814.intercom-clicks.com/via/e?ob=%2BAeeZatYDEUEOCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxSFeLKPFc%3D&h=451b14b1058b66c6f1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxf528282-jlmqxicb_177349782&l=dfc059fcxxxxxxxxxxd9050514-129995864" style="...">BLACKBOX.AI</a>`
  - An unsubscribe link: `<a href="https://blackbox-bc48d2c6d814.intercom-mail.com/subscriptions/unsubscribe?app_id=jlmqxicb&conversation_id=177349782&user_id=66c6e2xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx4a152&source=body" style="...">Unsubscribe from our emails</a>`
  - A "Powered by Intercom" link: `<a href="https://blackbox-bc48d2c6d814.intercom-mail.com/via/e?ob=R%2Bu8oPqfw3KOrIAjpHPUw25vNsVrocwxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx9br4RwAVd9XIl2V7WXkTAubjPAMaico6%2FO7CbaEpVLX7n42N%2B1Tm7wP0ST21fRs%3D&h=d29xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxd45aab263ce446f-jlmqxicb_177349782" style="...">Intercom</a>`
  All these links go through "intercom-clicks.com" or "intercom-mail.com," indicating click tracking. For instance, the BLACKBOX.AI link redirects through [BLACKBOX.AI](https://blackbox-bc48d2c6d814.intercom-clicks.com/via/e?ob=%2BAeeZatYDEUEOCxHNVgoa34Nm2q7l7Ppxxxxxxxxxxxxxx3D&h=451b14b1058b66c6f1ced82d6556afd50f528282-jlmqxicb_177349782&l=dfc059fce38d0fxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx9050514-129xxxxxxxxxxxxxx4), likely incrementing a click counter before forwarding to the destination.

#### Research on Intercom’s Tracking Practices
To confirm these observations, research was conducted into Intercom’s email tracking capabilities. Intercom is known to provide open tracking and click tracking as part of its email marketing features, as evidenced by:
- [Email marketing best practices Intercom Help](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/235-email-marketing-best-practices), which discusses setting goals and implies tracking engagement.
- [Email sending FAQs Intercom Help](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/8797915-email-sending-faqs), noting, “Intercom helps you to measure success of a message with open tracking, goal tracking and click tracking.”
- [What is click tracking? Intercom Help](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/2706708-what-is-click-tracking), stating, “Click tracking works by overwriting the link in the body of a message to go through our own portal before redirecting a user to the final destination.”

These sources confirm that Intercom uses tracking pixels for open tracking and modifies links for click tracking, aligning with what was found in the email.

#### User Control and Opt-Out Options
The analysis also considered whether users can opt out of this tracking. Research into Intercom’s practices shows:
- There is no direct way for recipients to opt out of open tracking, as it relies on loading images, which users can block through email client settings (e.g., disabling image loading in Gmail).
- For click tracking, Intercom allows senders (like Blackbox AI) to disable it, as seen in [Understand your outbound message stats Intercom Help](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/317-understand-your-outbound-message-stats), where it mentions, “Yes, so long as the customer has click tracking enabled.” However, this is a sender-side setting, not available to recipients.
- The email includes an unsubscribe link for opting out of future emails, but this does not affect tracking for the current email.

#### Privacy Policy Review
Blackbox AI’s privacy policy ([Blackbox AI Privacy Policy](https://blackbox.ai/privacy-policy)) was reviewed in previous analyses and does not explicitly mention email tracking. It states data collected includes email, name, password, and geolocation, used for service provision and marketing, but lacks detail on email-specific tracking practices. This omission might raise transparency concerns, especially given the tracking observed in the email.

#### Comparative Analysis and Controversy
The tracking observed is standard for email marketing, as seen in industry practices discussed in [Email marketing best practices Intercom Help](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/235-email-marketing-best-practices), which mentions tracking opens and clicks to measure engagement. However, the lack of explicit disclosure in Blackbox AI’s email or policy could be controversial, particularly for users concerned about privacy. Community discussions, such as [How do you track email opens in Intercom? Community](https://community.intercom.com/apps-integrations-25/how-do-you-track-email-opens-in-intercom-304), highlight user frustration with tracking, though solutions are limited.

#### Conclusion
The email from Blackbox AI contains tracking mechanisms, including tracking pixels and click-tracking links, supporting the user's concerns about data collection. These practices are standard for emails sent via Intercom, used to measure engagement, but lack explicit disclosure in Blackbox AI’s communications, potentially raising privacy concerns. Users cannot directly opt out of tracking through Blackbox AI or Intercom, relying instead on email client settings. This analysis confirms the presence of tracking, aligning with the user's claims, and highlights the need for greater transparency in email marketing practices.
