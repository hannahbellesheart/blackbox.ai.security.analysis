## Tracking Emails

The vast majority of the emails contain trackers... Most of them contain at least 3 trackers... Not only that, they send at least 2 emails per day and offer a free pro account that is actually not honored and if you have ublock or malwarebytes turned on, the links they send are blocked.

The email contains tracking pixels. Tracking pixels are typically small, invisible images embedded in emails to monitor recipient activity, such as opens or clicks. Here are the identified tracking pixels:

1. **Transparent tracking pixel**:
   - `<img border="0" width="1" height="1" src="https://blackbox-ai-32853b63f3c1.intercom-mail.com/q/0oWF-C8axzVHmlGdREEMXg~~/AAAAARA~/S2JupJ69WyJ9rZxl7aCaymeof-Fyal0xKFiewiw_QqkBX0B4mFeP6CSYWBvbZIaCP8efeT4mZW3Cbt_DswLz3gw~~" alt="" />`
   - This pixel is hidden with attributes like `width="1"` and `height="1"`, making it invisible to the recipient.

2. **Another tracking pixel**:
   - `<img src="https://blackbox-ai-32853b63f3c1.intercom-mail.com/via/o?h=6a56523501cb9e0aef178836f9cee1009a7252fc-x55eda6t_1167718" width="1" height="1" style="display: block;" alt="intercom">`
   - This pixel is used for monitoring purposes, as indicated by its dimensions and placement.

3. **Additional tracking pixel**:
   - `<img border="0" width="1" height="1" alt="" src="https://blackbox-ai-32853b63f3c1.intercom-mail.com/q/OVoYp9YD2n0U0XELtpWlQg~~/AAAAARA~/DZLPWRKxYGarhQF8ojfaCBCBBvMrSuxSreMQkERlEdlZUt8LOVEm4inpTzLGfmqxChNYHplINCMKbH0LW5bMww~~">`
   - Similar to the others, this pixel is designed to track recipient activity.

These tracking pixels are commonly used by email marketing platforms to gather analytics on user engagement. If you want to prevent tracking, you can disable image loading in your email client or use privacy-focused tools/extensions that block such trackers.
